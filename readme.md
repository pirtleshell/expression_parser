# expression_parser

A simple expression parser written in Rust

## why

I wrote this to experiment with trees in rust and to practice some sweet design patterns. I'm hoping to make a more complicated parser in the future, so this was just some practice. It does addition, subtraction, and negation. It also handles multiplication and division, but it doesn't respect order of operations...yet?
