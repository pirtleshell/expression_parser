# expression_parser

A simple expression parser written in Rust

## why

I wrote this to experiment with trees in rust and to practice some sweet design patterns. I'm hoping to make a more complicated parser in the future, so this was just some practice. It does addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, & negation. Follows order of operations with support for parentheses, too!
